        because it offered quality professional education where there is a perfect
        blend of theory and practical at a very affordable cost and structured
        extracurricular programs which help to build the morals and character of
        students. <br><br> runs various programs authorized by the Ministry of Higher
        Education and the Ministry of Employment and Vocational Training for the

                Prior to studying in Ebenezer higher Institute of Science and
                Technology, I had challenges blending study and work.However, upon
                enrollment, the administration adapted a structured program which
                facilitated work and studies. I am a graduate in the department of
                nursing and currently a Masters student in Public Health with Ebenezer
                higher Institute of Science and Technology.I am grateful for the quality
